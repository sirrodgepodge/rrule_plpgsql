## Why Use This?

### Consistency Across Environments

By using the same PL/pgSQL implementation everywhere (local dev, testing, staging, production), you eliminate subtle bugs from implementation differences.

### No Compilation Required

Pure SQL means:
- No C compiler needed
- No build step for PostgreSQL extensions
- Easier CI/CD pipelines
- Simpler Docker images
- Works immediately after installation

### Excellent Performance

**50-75x faster than Node.js rrule.js processing** - plenty fast for most applications while avoiding the complexity of C extensions.

### Universal Compatibility

Works on:
- ✅ **Google Cloud AlloyDB** - Managed PostgreSQL service
- ✅ **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** - No custom extensions needed
- ✅ **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** - Fully supported
- ✅ **Self-hosted PostgreSQL** - No special configuration
- ✅ **Docker PostgreSQL** - Standard postgres image

## Supported RRULE Patterns

### Frequencies
- ✅ `FREQ=DAILY` - Daily recurrence with BYDAY, BYMONTH, BYMONTHDAY
- ✅ `FREQ=WEEKLY` - Weekly with BYDAY, BYMONTH, BYSETPOS
- ✅ `FREQ=MONTHLY` - Monthly with BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYSETPOS
- ✅ `FREQ=YEARLY` - Yearly with BYMONTH, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY

### Modifiers
- ✅ `COUNT` - Limit number of occurrences
- ✅ `UNTIL` - Date/time limit
- ✅ `INTERVAL` - Recurrence interval (every N days/weeks/months/years)
- ✅ `BYDAY` - Weekday rules (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU)
- ✅ `BYDAY` with position - (1MO = first Monday, -1FR = last Friday, 2TU = second Tuesday)
- ✅ `BYMONTHDAY` - Day of month (1-31, or -1 for last day, -2 for second-to-last, etc.)
- ✅ `BYMONTH` - Month of year (1-12)
- ✅ `BYSETPOS` - Position within set

### Not Currently Implemented
- ⏸️ `FREQ=HOURLY`, `FREQ=MINUTELY`, `FREQ=SECONDLY`
- ⏸️ `BYYEARDAY` (day of year)
- ⏸️ `BYWEEKNO` (week number)
- ⏸️ `BYHOUR`, `BYMINUTE`, `BYSECOND`

Most calendar applications use DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY/YEARLY frequencies, which are fully supported.

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct SQL Installation

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
git clone https://github.com/sirrodgepodge/rrule_plpgsql.git
cd rrule_plpgsql

# Install to your database
psql -d your_database -f src/install.sql
```

### Option 2: Copy SQL File

For frameworks like TypeORM, copy `src/rrule.sql` into your migrations or SQL directory and execute it.

```typescript
// Example: TypeORM migration
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

export class InstallRRulePlpgsql implements MigrationInterface {
    public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
        const sqlPath = path.join(__dirname, 'path/to/rrule.sql');
        const sql = fs.readFileSync(sqlPath, 'utf8');
        await queryRunner.query(sql);
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### get_occurrences()

Get an array of all occurrences for a given RRULE.

**Signature:**
```sql
get_occurrences(rrule VARCHAR, dtstart TIMESTAMP) -> TIMESTAMP[]
get_occurrences(rrule VARCHAR, dtstart TIMESTAMP, until TIMESTAMP) -> TIMESTAMP[]
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Get first 5 daily occurrences
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=5',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));

-- Every Monday, Wednesday, Friday for 10 occurrences
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR;COUNT=10',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));

-- Monthly on the 15th
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15;COUNT=12',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));

-- Last day of every month
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=-1;COUNT=12',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));

-- Second Monday of each month
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=2MO;COUNT=12',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));

-- Yearly on January 15th
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1;BYMONTHDAY=15;COUNT=5',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));
```

### get_next_occurrence()

Get the next single occurrence after a given time.

**Signature:**
```sql
get_next_occurrence(rrule VARCHAR, dtstart TIMESTAMP, after TIMESTAMP) -> TIMESTAMP
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Get next Monday after today
SELECT get_next_occurrence(
    'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP,
    NOW()::TIMESTAMP
);
```

### adjust_rrule_for_month_end()

Helper function to convert high month days (29, 30, 31) to last-day notation (-1).

**Signature:**
```sql
adjust_rrule_for_month_end(rrule VARCHAR) -> VARCHAR
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Convert "31st of month" to "last day of month" for February compatibility
SELECT adjust_rrule_for_month_end('FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=31');
-- Returns: 'FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=-1'
```

## Usage Examples

### Simple Patterns

```sql
-- Every day for 7 days
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=7', '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP));

-- Every week for 4 weeks
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences('FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=4', '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP));

-- Every month for 12 months
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences('FREQ=MONTHLY;COUNT=12', '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP));
```

### With INTERVAL

```sql
-- Every 2 days
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences('FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=2;COUNT=5', '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP));

-- Every 3 weeks
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences('FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=3;COUNT=4', '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP));

-- Every 6 months
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences('FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=6;COUNT=4', '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP));
```

### Complex Patterns

```sql
-- First and last Monday of each month
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1MO,-1MO;COUNT=12',
    '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));

-- Weekdays (Monday through Friday)
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;COUNT=20',
    '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));

-- First day and 15th of every month
SELECT unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1,15;COUNT=12',
    '2025-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
));
```

### Application Integration

```sql
-- Find next occurrence for a recurring meeting
SELECT occurrence
FROM unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE;INTERVAL=1',
    '2025-01-01 14:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
)) AS occurrence
WHERE occurrence > NOW()::TIMESTAMP
ORDER BY occurrence ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- Get all occurrences in the next 30 days
SELECT occurrence
FROM unnest(get_occurrences(
    'FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1,2,3',
    '2025-01-01 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
)) AS occurrence
WHERE occurrence BETWEEN NOW()::TIMESTAMP
  AND (NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days')::TIMESTAMP
ORDER BY occurrence;
```

## Timezone Handling

This implementation uses timezone-naive `TIMESTAMP` (not `TIMESTAMPTZ`). This is intentional and matches the behavior of most calendar applications:

- **Wall-clock times**: "10:00 AM every Monday" stays "10:00 AM" regardless of timezone
- **No DST adjustments**: Time doesn't shift when crossing DST boundaries
- **Consistent with rrule.js**: Matches the behavior of the JavaScript rrule library

**Recommendation**: Store RRULE data in UTC timestamps and convert to user's timezone in your application layer.

## Performance

Benchmarks on PostgreSQL 16 (M1 MacBook Pro):

| Operation | Throughput | vs Node.js rrule.js |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| DAILY (100 occurrences) | ~200/sec | **~50x faster** |
| WEEKLY with BYDAY (52 weeks) | ~150/sec | **~60x faster** |
| MONTHLY with BYDAY (24 months) | ~100/sec | **~75x faster** |

**Note**: While C extensions like pg_rrule can be 2x faster than this PL/pgSQL implementation, they don't work on managed PostgreSQL services (AlloyDB, RDS, etc.) and add deployment complexity. This implementation provides excellent performance with maximum portability.

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite included in `tests/test_rrule_functions.sql`:

```bash
# Run test suite
psql -d your_database -f tests/test_rrule_functions.sql
```

Test coverage:
- ✅ DAILY patterns (simple, with BYDAY, with INTERVAL)
- ✅ WEEKLY patterns (single day, multiple days, with BYSETPOS)
- ✅ MONTHLY patterns (BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, positional BYDAY, negative BYMONTHDAY)
- ✅ YEARLY patterns
- ✅ COUNT and UNTIL termination
- ✅ Edge cases (February 29, month-end handling)
