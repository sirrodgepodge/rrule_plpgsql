# rrule_plpgsql

Pure PL/pgSQL implementation of iCalendar RRULE (RFC 5545) for PostgreSQL. No C extensions, no compilation, works everywhere.

---

## Overview

This library provides complete RRULE recurrence calculation functionality using pure PL/pgSQL. **Use this implementation for all environments** (local, development, staging, production) to ensure consistency.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **No C extensions required** - Pure PL/pgSQL, works on any PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ **Full timezone support with DST handling** - Wall-clock time preserved ("10 AM stays 10 AM" across DST transitions)
- ‚úÖ **Consistent everywhere** - Same implementation across all environments
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Comprehensive test suite with 168 tests (including table operation integration tests)
- ‚úÖ **RFC 5545 & RFC 7529 compliant** - Supports standard RRULE patterns plus SKIP/RSCALE
- ‚úÖ **50-75x faster than Node.js** - Excellent performance without compilation
- ‚úÖ **Works on managed services** - AlloyDB, RDS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL

---

## Why This Approach?

### Query Engine Integration

**Computation where your data lives** delivers performance impossible with external processing:
- **Set-based operations**: JOIN recurrence rules against events, bookings, or any table without data transfer
- **Native WHERE/aggregation**: Filter by occurrence dates, COUNT occurrences, GROUP BY - all in SQL
- **Batch processing**: Process 100+ schedules in a single query without round trips
- **Memory-efficient streaming**: SETOF returns results incrementally, not all at once
- **50-75x faster than Node.js** for single-schedule operations, infinitely faster for multi-schedule batch queries

**See [Example Usage](EXAMPLE_USAGE.md) for practical patterns including subscription billing, batch updates, and conflict detection.**

### Zero Compilation

Pure PL/pgSQL means:
- ‚úÖ No C compiler or build tools required
- ‚úÖ Install with a single SQL file - no configuration
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across all environments (dev, staging, production)

**Universal compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ **Google AlloyDB** - High-performance PostgreSQL with AI integration
- ‚úÖ **Google Cloud SQL** - Fully managed PostgreSQL service
- ‚úÖ **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL** - Serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- ‚úÖ **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** - Managed PostgreSQL without custom extensions
- ‚úÖ **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** - Fully supported managed service
- ‚úÖ **Self-hosted PostgreSQL** - No special configuration required
- ‚úÖ **Docker PostgreSQL** - Standard postgres image compatibility

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via psql
psql -d your_database -f src/install.sql

# Or use curl for one-line install
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirrodgepodge/rrule_plpgsql/main/src/install.sql | psql -d your_database

**Next Steps:** See [Example Usage](EXAMPLE_USAGE.md) for practical patterns including subscription billing, batch operations, and calendar scheduling.

## Key Features

### Supported Frequencies

**‚úÖ Production-Ready (Always Enabled):**
- `FREQ=DAILY` - Daily recurrence with date/time filters
- `FREQ=WEEKLY` - Weekly recurrence with day-of-week selection
- `FREQ=MONTHLY` - Monthly recurrence with day/week-of-month selection
- `FREQ=YEARLY` - Yearly recurrence with month/day/week selection

**‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced (Optional, Disabled by Default):**
- `FREQ=HOURLY` - Hourly recurrence (8,760/year max)
- `FREQ=MINUTELY` - Minutely recurrence (525,600/year max)
- `FREQ=SECONDLY` - Secondly recurrence (31M/year max)

See **[Sub-Day Operations Guide](INCLUDING_SUBDAY_OPERATIONS.md)** for enabling these safely.

### Supported Modifiers

- `COUNT` - Limit number of occurrences
- `UNTIL` - End date for recurrence
- `INTERVAL` - Frequency multiplier (every N days/weeks/months)
- `BYDAY` - Filter by day of week (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU)
- `BYDAY` with ordinals - Positioned weekdays (2MO = 2nd Monday, -1FR = last Friday)
- `BYMONTHDAY` - Filter by day of month (1-31, -1 = last day)
- `BYMONTH` - Filter by month (1-12)
- `BYYEARDAY` - Filter by day of year (1-366, negative supported)
- `BYWEEKNO` - Filter by ISO week number (1-53, YEARLY only)
- `BYSETPOS` - Select specific positions from generated set
- `WKST` - Week start day (SU, MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA)
- `SKIP` - Invalid date handling (OMIT, BACKWARD, FORWARD)
- `TZID` - Timezone specification with automatic DST handling
- `RSCALE` - Calendar system (GREGORIAN supported)

**See [RFC Spec Compliance](SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md) for complete feature support matrix and examples.**

### Timezone Support

**Full RFC 5545 timezone support with automatic DST handling:**

```sql
-- Meeting stays at 10 AM wall-clock time across DST boundary
SELECT * FROM rrule.all(
    'FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3;TZID=America/New_York',
    '2025-03-08 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP
);
-- Returns: March 8 (EST), March 9 (EDT), March 10 (EDT)
-- All at 10:00 AM wall-clock time
```

**See [API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md) for TIMESTAMPTZ API details.**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Invalid RRULE: FREQ parameter is required"**
- Every RRULE must start with FREQ
- Fix: Add `FREQ=DAILY` (or WEEKLY/MONTHLY/YEARLY)

**Error: "COUNT and UNTIL are mutually exclusive"**
- Cannot use both COUNT and UNTIL in same RRULE
- Fix: Use either `COUNT=10` OR `UNTIL=20251231T235959`

**Error: "BYWEEKNO can only be used with FREQ=YEARLY"**
- BYWEEKNO requires YEARLY frequency
- Fix: Change to `FREQ=YEARLY;BYWEEKNO=10`

**See [Validation Rules](VALIDATION.md) for complete error reference.**

## API Overview

**Both APIs are fully timezone-aware with automatic DST handling.**

### TIMESTAMP API (timezone via TZID in RRULE)

```sql
-- Get all occurrences (supports TZID= in rrule for timezone/DST handling)
SELECT * FROM rrule.all(rrule, dtstart);

-- Get occurrences in date range
SELECT * FROM rrule.between(rrule, dtstart, start_date, end_date);

-- Get first occurrence after date
SELECT rrule.after(rrule, dtstart, after_date);

-- Get last occurrence before date
SELECT rrule.before(rrule, dtstart, before_date);

-- Count total occurrences
SELECT rrule.count(rrule, dtstart);

-- Convenience: next occurrence from now
SELECT rrule.next(rrule, dtstart);

-- Convenience: most recent occurrence
SELECT rrule.most_recent(rrule, dtstart);

-- Example with timezone (DST-aware):
SELECT * FROM rrule.all('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=5;TZID=America/New_York', '2025-03-08 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP);
```

### TIMESTAMPTZ API (timezone via explicit parameter)

```sql
-- Explicit timezone parameter (can override TZID in RRULE)
SELECT * FROM rrule.all(rrule, dtstart_tz, timezone);
SELECT * FROM rrule.between(rrule, dtstart_tz, start, end, timezone);
SELECT * FROM rrule.after(rrule, dtstart_tz, after, count, timezone);
SELECT * FROM rrule.before(rrule, dtstart_tz, before, count, timezone);

-- Example with timezone parameter:
SELECT * FROM rrule.all('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=5', '2025-03-08 10:00:00-05'::TIMESTAMPTZ, 'America/New_York');
```

## Performance

**Single schedule:** 50-75x faster than Node.js rrule.js
**Multi-schedule queries:** Eliminates application-database round trips entirely

**Scalability advantages:**
- Set-based batch operations: Query 100+ schedules in parallel without loops
- Streaming results: SETOF returns incrementally, not all at once (constant memory)
- Query planner optimization: PostgreSQL optimizes JOINs and filters with occurrence expansion
- Early-exit optimizations: Stops computation when COUNT/UNTIL limits reached

**See [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for architecture and benchmarking details.**

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- No C extensions required
- No external dependencies
- Works on all PostgreSQL-compatible platforms

**See [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for development setup instructions.**
